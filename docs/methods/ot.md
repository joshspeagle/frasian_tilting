## Summary

Wasserstein-2 (optimal-transport) geodesic tilting between the
posterior and the likelihood-induced Gaussian. The general 1D
implementation uses the **quantile-mixture** representation
`F_t^{-1}(u) = (1-t)·F_p^{-1}(u) + t·F_q^{-1}(u)` (McCann
displacement interpolation), which works for any two endpoints
exposing `quantile`. On the Normal-Normal sandbox this collapses to
linear interpolation in `(mu, sigma)` and the tilted distribution
stays Gaussian — the implementation recognises this Gaussian fast
path. Endpoints follow the framework convention `eta=0` -> posterior,
`eta=1` -> likelihood-as-Gaussian, matching `power_law`.

### Endpoint convention across schemes

The framework uses a uniform endpoint contract: every `TiltingScheme`
anchors `eta=0` at the posterior (the identity / no-tilt endpoint) and
moves the family toward the likelihood as `eta` increases. Source of
truth: `tilting/power_law.py` lines ~91-94 (`eta_default=0.0`,
`eta_identity=0.0`, "eta=0 recovers WALDO; eta=1 recovers Wald").

| Scheme        | `eta=0`              | `eta=1` (or other distinguished) | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| `identity`    | posterior            | (no other endpoint)              | No-op; the matrix's identity element. |
| `power_law`   | posterior            | `eta=1` → Wald (likelihood-only) | e-geodesic; admissible η < 1/(1-w) (upper-only; no finite lower per PL brief §A2). |
| `ot`          | posterior            | `eta=1` → likelihood-as-Gaussian | W2 displacement line; the *segment* is [0,1]. Extrapolation along the line is admissible whenever the result is well-defined: Gaussian path requires σ_t > 0, closed-form pvalue requires η > -w/(1-w). |
| `mixture`     | posterior            | `eta=1` → likelihood-as-Gaussian | m-geodesic, dual partner of `power_law`; implemented (Stage A+B with closed-form NN tilt + WALDO p-value, structural sigmoid (0,1) bound on EtaNet output per row 13c). |
| `fisher_rao`  | posterior            | `eta=1` → likelihood-as-Gaussian | Levi-Civita / Fisher-Rao geodesic; implemented (Stages A-D — closed-form half-plane geodesic, diffrax shooting BVP, Phase G v4 learned-η, smoothness comparison). |

All implemented schemes set `param_space.eta_identity = 0.0`; tests in
`tests/properties/` enforce `tilt(posterior, prior, lik, eta=0) ==
posterior` for each.

## Motivation

`power_law` (the e-geodesic / log-linear path) clamps against
`eta = -w/(1-w)` near the prior boundary; this clamp is a
parameterisation artefact, not a feature of the data, and produces a
sharp transition in the smoothness diagnostic
(`docs/methods/smoothness_experiment.md`). The W2 geodesic is the
**displacement** path between the same endpoints — interpolation in
mass-transport coordinates rather than in log-density coordinates —
and is structurally clamp-free on `[0, 1]`. The framework's central
hypothesis is that this geometry produces a smoother `eta*(|Delta|)`
curve at the same calibration. (Hypothesis specific to this
framework; no prior empirical evidence.)

This scheme is the third of three natural geometries on the space of
distributions: e-geodesic (`power_law`), m-geodesic (`mixture`), and
the Wasserstein geodesic (this method). The first two are the dually
flat pair under the Fisher metric (Amari & Nagaoka 2000); W2 is a
distinct, mass-displacement geometry (Pistone & Malagò 2018; Takatsu
2011).

## Definition

For two 1D distributions `p` and `q` with finite second moments, the
constant-speed W2 geodesic at `t in [0, 1]` is the **quantile-mixture**

```
F_t^{-1}(u) = (1 - t) · F_p^{-1}(u) + t · F_q^{-1}(u),  u in [0, 1].
```

Equivalently, the law of `(1-t)·F_p^{-1}(U) + t·F_q^{-1}(U)` for
`U ~ Uniform[0, 1]` (McCann 1997; Villani 2003 Ch. 2; Santambrogio
2015 Ch. 2). For Borel measures with finite variance the formula is
exact even with atoms; the framework's tilting only needs absolutely-
continuous endpoints, so no caveats apply here.

**Gaussian fast path.** When both endpoints are Gaussian the
geodesic stays in the Gaussian family and admits the closed form

```
mu_t    = (1 - t) · mu_a + t · mu_b
sigma_t = (1 - t) · sigma_a + t · sigma_b      (linear in sigma, NOT sigma^2)
```

(Olkin & Pukelsheim 1982; Dowson & Landau 1982; Takatsu 2011; Bhatia,
Jain & Lim 2019). Note: `sigma_t^2 = ((1-t)·sigma_a + t·sigma_b)^2`,
**not** `(1-t)·sigma_a^2 + t·sigma_b^2`.

**Endpoints.** The framework anchors the path at posterior (eta=0)
and the likelihood-induced Gaussian `N(D, sigma^2)` (eta=1):

```
mu_t    = (1 - eta) · mu_n + eta · D
sigma_t = (1 - eta) · sigma_n + eta · sigma.
```

## Derivation

**1D W2 geodesic = quantile-mixture.** For 1D measures the optimal
transport map under quadratic cost is the monotone rearrangement
`T = F_q^{-1} ∘ F_p` (Brenier 1991; Villani 2003 §2.2). McCann's
displacement interpolation `((1-t)·id + t·T)_# p` evaluated at this
map gives the quantile formula above (Santambrogio 2015 Prop. 2.13).

**Gaussian closed form.** For univariate Gaussians the quantile is
`F^{-1}(u) = mu + sigma · Phi^{-1}(u)`, so the quantile-mixture's
quantile is `((1-t)mu_a + t mu_b) + ((1-t)sigma_a + t sigma_b)·
Phi^{-1}(u)` — the quantile of `N(mu_t, sigma_t^2)` with the linear
form above (multivariate analogue: Bures-Wasserstein, Bhatia-Jain-Lim
2019).

**OT-tilted WALDO p-value (Normal-Normal sandbox).** Substituting the
W2-tilted posterior into the WALDO formula produces a closed-form
p-value. The key identity: `mu_t` is a linear function of `D` with
slope `dmu_t/dD = w + eta·(1 - w)`, so under repeated sampling
`D | theta ~ N(theta, sigma^2)`,

```
s_t := sd(mu_t | theta) = (w + eta · (1 - w)) · sigma,
E[mu_t - theta | theta]  = (1 - eta) · (1 - w) · (mu0 - theta).
```

Substituting into the bare WALDO structure gives

```
a(theta) = |mu_t - theta| / s_t
b(theta) = (1 - eta) · (1 - w) · (mu0 - theta) / s_t
p(theta) = Phi(b - a) + Phi(-a - b).
```

Endpoint sanity (verified symbolically + 2000 random numerical draws,
atol = 0):
- At `eta = 0`: `s_t = w · sigma`, `mu_t = mu_n`, formula collapses
  to bare WALDO (matches `src/frasian/statistics/waldo.py:36-42`).
- At `eta = 1`: `s_t = sigma`, `mu_t = D`, `b = 0`, `a = |D-theta|/sigma`,
  so `p = 2 · Phi(-|D-theta|/sigma)` — bare two-sided Wald.

**`s_t` vs `sigma_t` — a subtle but important distinction.** The
standard error `s_t` appearing in the p-value is **not** the W2-
geodesic posterior std `sigma_t = (1 - eta)·sigma_n + eta·sigma`.
The two coincide only at `eta = 1`:

```
s_t(0)     = w · sigma             sigma_t(0)     = sqrt(w) · sigma
s_t(1)     = sigma                 sigma_t(1)     = sigma
```

`s_t` is the dispersion of `mu_t` as an estimator of `theta` (a
sampling SD); `sigma_t` is the spread of the tilted posterior (a
distributional SD). The bare WALDO denominator is
`sd(mu_n | theta) = w·sigma` — see `src/frasian/statistics/waldo.py:40-41`
— not `sigma_n = sqrt(w)·sigma`; the same logic applies under
tilting, hence `s_t`, not `sigma_t`, in the formula. A future reader
expecting `sigma_t` will see the eta=0 endpoint break by ~0.35 in
p-value error on the canonical sandbox.

## Admissibility (general statement + NN closed form)

**Setup.** The Wasserstein-2 (W2) geodesic between two 1D distributions
`p` and `q` on the real line, by the McCann interpolation theorem, is
the quantile mixture

    F_t^{-1}(u) = (1 − t) F_p^{-1}(u) + t F_q^{-1}(u),    u ∈ [0, 1],

In the Frasian convention `p = posterior`, `q = likelihood-as-distribution`
(a Gaussian centred at `D` with variance `σ²`); `η ≡ t` so `η = 0` is the
posterior, `η = 1` is the likelihood.

A 1D distribution is uniquely determined by a CDF, and a function
`F: ℝ → [0, 1]` is a valid CDF iff it is non-decreasing, right-continuous,
with `F(−∞)=0`, `F(+∞)=1`. Equivalently, `F_t^{-1}` must be non-decreasing
on `(0, 1)` for `F_t = (F_t^{-1})^{-1}` to be a CDF.

**(B1) General admissibility.** Differentiating `F_t^{-1}(u)` in `u`:

    d/du F_t^{-1}(u) = (1 − t) q_p(u) + t q_q(u),
    where q_•(u) = dF_•^{-1}/du = 1/f_•(F_•^{-1}(u)) ≥ 0.

- **For `t ∈ [0, 1]`**: both `(1-t) ≥ 0` and `t ≥ 0`, so derivative ≥ 0.
  **Always admissible.** (McCann displacement interpolation.)
- **For `t ∉ [0, 1]`**: one coefficient negative. Admissibility iff
  `(1 − t) q_p(u) + t q_q(u) ≥ 0  ∀ u ∈ (0, 1)`.

In terms of the spread ratio `r(u) ≡ q_p(u) / q_q(u) > 0`:

- `t < 0`:  need `t ≥ -r(u)/(1 - r(u))` for `r(u) < 1`. The binding
  bound is `t ≥ -inf_u r(u)/(1 - r(u))` over `{u: r(u) < 1}`.
- `t > 1`:  need `t ≤ r(u)/(r(u) - 1)` for `r(u) > 1`. Binding bound
  `t ≤ inf_u r(u)/(r(u) - 1)` over `{u: r(u) > 1}`.

In words: admissibility outside `[0, 1]` depends on the per-quantile
spread ratio of `p` and `q`. In the framework's standard case
(prior narrower than likelihood, `σ_p < σ_q`), `r(u) < 1` everywhere
on NN — only the lower bound is finite, the upper bound is `+∞`.

**(B2) NN closed form.** For `p = N(μ_p, σ_p²)`, `q = N(μ_q, σ_q²)`,

    F_t^{-1}(u) = [(1 - t) μ_p + t μ_q]  +  [(1 - t) σ_p + t σ_q] · Φ^{-1}(u).

Tilted distribution is `N(μ_t, σ_t²)` with `σ_t = (1 - t) σ_p + t σ_q`.
**Admissibility ⇔ `σ_t > 0`.**

Framework convention: `σ_p = √w · σ` (posterior), `σ_q = σ` (likelihood).

    σ_t = σ · [√w + t(1 − √w)].

Solving `σ_t = 0`:

    t* = −√w / (1 − √w).

Since `√w ∈ (0, 1)`, `1 − √w > 0` so the slope is positive. Admissibility:

    **η ∈ (−√w/(1 − √w), +∞)** — lower bound only, no finite upper.

| `w`  | `σ`  | analytic lower bound          |
|------|------|-------------------------------|
| 0.2  | 1.0  | `−0.80901699...`              |
| 0.5  | 2.0  | `−2.41421356...`              |
| 0.8  | 1.0  | `−8.47213595...`              |

**(B3) Resolve the empirical `(−0.25, ~1.9)` claim.** At `σ₀ = 0.5, σ = 1.0`
(w=0.2):

- **PL fallback**: `(−w/(1−w), 1/(1−w)) = (−0.25, +1.25)`. Wrong for OT in
  both directions.
- **True OT**: `(−0.80901699, +∞)`.

The PL bounds come from the natural-parameter / precision space. OT lives
in the scale-mixture parameter space, which has a different (in fact more
permissive on the negative side, unbounded above) admissibility region.

**(B4) Non-NN sketch (Beta-Beta).** No closed-form `Φ`-style decomposition.
Admissibility outside `[0, 1]` requires

    inf_{u ∈ (0,1)}  [(1−t) / f_p(F_p^{-1}(u)) + t / f_q(F_q^{-1}(u))]  ≥  0,

evaluated numerically on a quantile grid.

**(B5) Implementation sketch.**

1. **NN fast path** (`ot.py` lines 884–902): compute
   `σ_t = (1 − η) σ_p + η σ_q`, raise `TiltingDomainError` if `σ_t ≤ 0`.
2. **Generic path**: build `F_t^{-1}` on a u-grid (e.g. 4096 points),
   check `np.all(np.diff(F_t_inv) >= -atol)`. Fold into
   `QuantileMixturePath` constructor.
3. **Endpoint shortcut**: `η ∈ [0, 1]` always admissible, skip check.

## Predicted behavior

- **Smoothness.** `eta*(|Delta|)` curve has no clamp (admissible
  range is `[0, 1]` for all `|Delta|`). Lipschitz value on the
  smoothness diagnostic is expected to be smaller than `power_law`'s
  by an order of magnitude. (Hypothesis specific to this framework.)
- **Coverage.** Calibrated under `DynamicNumericalEtaSelector` (the
  η used at each θ depends only on θ, so the WALDO p-value at fixed
  η is U[0,1] under H0 and the CI achieves nominal 1-α coverage by
  construction — same argument as `power_law[dynamic_numerical]`).
- **Width.** η=0 recovers WALDO width; η=1 recovers Wald width.
  Interior optima depend on `|Delta|`; comparison with `power_law` is
  the empirical question the framework exists to answer.
- **Endpoint identities.** At `eta = 0` the tilted-WALDO p-value is
  exactly bare WALDO. At `eta = 1` it is exactly bare two-sided Wald.

## Failure modes

- **Variance-mode interpolation `sigma_t^2 = (1-t)sigma_a^2 + t·sigma_b^2`
  is wrong.** That curve is not the W2 geodesic; using it would break
  the smoothness comparison. The implementation uses linear-in-sigma.
- **`s_t != sigma_t` confusion.** See Derivation; the WALDO
  denominator is the sampling SD `s_t`, not the geodesic-interpolated
  posterior std `sigma_t`.
- **Non-Gaussian likelihood.** The current `OTTilting.tilt`
  implementation requires `GaussianLikelihood` for the likelihood-to-
  distribution conversion; other `Likelihood` types raise
  `NotImplementedError` (matches `power_law`'s discipline). The
  general path machinery (`QuantileMixturePath`) is, however,
  agnostic to the endpoint family — it runs on any pair of
  `Distribution` instances. The illustration exercises this by
  interpolating between two Beta distributions.

## Invariants

(Property tests in `tests/properties/test_ot_invariants.py`.)

- `tilt(eta=0)` returns a Gaussian numerically equal to the input
  posterior (atol 1e-12).
- `tilt(eta=1)` returns `N(D, sigma^2)` (atol 1e-12).
- `tilt(...).scale > 0` for every `eta in [0, 1]`.
- `tilt` is continuous in `eta` (Lipschitz constant ≤ 10 on the
  Hypothesis test range).
- McCann segment `eta ∈ [0, 1]` is always admissible (verified per
  §B1). Extrapolation outside is admissible whenever the Gaussian-path
  `tilt()` yields `σ_t > 0` (the half-plane bound is `η > -√w/(1-√w)`,
  upper unbounded — see §B2). The closed-form WALDO `tilted_pvalue`
  has a tighter lower-only condition `η > -w/(1-w)` documented in the
  code path (lines 833/980-988); the runtime selectors
  (`LearnedDynamicEtaSelector._maybe_clamp_eta`) enforce these.
- `tilt(eta)` raises `TiltingDomainError` when `σ_t = (1-t)σ_p + tσ_q
  ≤ 0` (i.e. η below the path's half-plane bound) — never NaN.
  The earlier `[0, 1]` hard-raise was reverted in commit `f12466d` /
  `ef5c93b` per the deriver-corrected admissibility.
- **Quantile-mixture identity**: `QuantileMixturePath.quantile(u) =
  (1-t)·F_p^{-1}(u) + t·F_q^{-1}(u)` to atol 1e-12.
- **Endpoint p-value recoveries**: `tilted_pvalue(eta=0, ..., 'waldo')`
  equals `WaldoStatistic.pvalue` to atol 1e-12; `tilted_pvalue(eta=1,
  ..., 'waldo')` equals `2 · Phi(-|D-theta|/sigma)` to atol 1e-12.

## Status notes

The general-path machinery (`QuantileMixturePath`) is endpoint-
agnostic — it runs on any pair of `Distribution` instances exposing
`quantile`. The Gaussian fast path skips the wrapper for performance
and to keep the output in `NormalDistribution` so downstream
consumers hit closed-form scipy code.

The framework's calibrated default selector is
`DynamicNumericalEtaSelector` (per-θ varying η), same as `power_law`.
Cell name picks up the selector when non-default, e.g.
`ot[dynamic_numerical]` is the OT-WALDO calibrated cell.

### Generic numerical path (Phase 3d)

`OTTilting` now supports non-Normal-Normal pairings via a generic
numerical implementation. Dispatch in `confidence_regions` /
`confidence_interval` / `pvalue` routes through
`_generic_tilted_confidence_interval_ot` (or the per-θ pvalue
analogue) when `(model, prior)` is not the Normal-Normal pair.
Only **static** selectors are supported on the generic path
(dynamic selectors still require Normal-Normal — the dynamic
scanner builds its θ-window from `D ± search_mult * sigma`).

The generic-path geodesic is the **W2 quantile-mixture** between:
- **`p` = posterior**: directly from `model.posterior(data, prior)`
  (e.g. `Beta(α₀+k, β₀+n-k)` on Bernoulli + Beta prior).
- **`q` = likelihood-as-distribution**: a `GridDistribution` built
  from `log L(θ)` normalised over `model.support()`. For Bernoulli,
  this is `Beta(k+1, n-k+1)` shape on `[0, 1]`. **At `eta=1` the
  OT endpoint is therefore the *normalised likelihood as a proper
  density* on the support — NOT a Wald-like point-mass at the MLE,
  and NOT a Gaussian.** The distinction matters for non-Gaussian
  likelihoods: on Bernoulli with k=4 successes, n=6 trials, the
  η=1 endpoint has mean ≈ 5/8 ≈ 0.625 (the Beta(5, 3) mean), not
  0.667 (the MLE).

The MC tilted p-value uses the same CRN-seeded blake2b discipline
as `WaldoStatistic` and `PowerLawTilting._generic_tilted_pvalue`;
seed depends on `(data, model.fingerprint, prior.fingerprint, eta,
alpha)` but NOT on theta, enabling shared uniform streams across
brentq probes within one CI inversion AND across schemes (so the
smoothness experiment can directly compare PowerLaw vs OT MC
draws at fixed inputs).

Cross-path agreement on Normal-Normal is pinned at L3 across
`eta ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0}` in
`tests/regression/test_ot_generic_tilt.py::test_ot_generic_ci_matches_closed_form_normal_normal`.

**Failure modes specific to the generic path**:
- `OTTilting.tilt(posterior, prior, likelihood, eta)` (the public
  protocol method) raises `NotImplementedError` on non-Gaussian
  likelihood because it cannot construct the W2 second endpoint
  without `(model, data)`. Use `confidence_regions(...)` for the
  end-to-end flow, or call `_generic_tilt_ot(posterior, likelihood,
  eta, model=, data=, support=)` directly. (PowerLawTilting.tilt()
  doesn't have this constraint — it doesn't need data because the
  formula `log L + (1-η) log π` is computed at eval points; the
  asymmetry is intentional, see Failure modes in `power_law.md`.)
- The generic CI inversion bracket is rooted at the OBSERVED
  tilted moments (not at the data MLE). For extreme data where
  the CI extends to the support boundary, the explicit boundary
  detection from Phase 3c-fix1 returns the support endpoint
  cleanly (no silent brentq exhaustion).

### Phase 4 entry point: `_ot_tilted_pvalue_kernel`

Mirrors `power_law`'s factoring (see `power_law.md`): a private
autodiff-clean JAX kernel `src/frasian/tilting/ot.py::_ot_tilted_pvalue_kernel`
wrapped in `@jax.jit(static_argnames=("statistic_name",))` is the
contract Phase 4's learned-η loss closes over. The public
`OTTilting.tilted_pvalue` validates `eta ∈ [0, 1]` in numpy and
shape-dispatches between the bulk JAX kernel and a numpy-eager
scalar fast path (`_ot_tilted_pvalue_numpy_scalar`, for brentq inner
loops).
